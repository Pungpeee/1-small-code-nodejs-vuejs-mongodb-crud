        Loy Krathong Day is one of the most popular festivals of Thailand
        celebrated annually on the Full-Moon Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month. It
        takes place at a time when the weather is fine as the rainy season is
        over and there is a high water level all over the country. "Loy" means
        "to float" and a "Krathong" is a lotus-shaped vessel made of banana
        leaves. The Krathong usually contains a candle, three joss-sticks, some
        flowers, and coins.

        In fact, the festival is of Brahmin origin in which people offer thanks
        to the Goddess of the water. Thus, by moonlight, people light the
        candles and joss-sticks, make a wish and launch their Krathongs on
        canals, rivers, or even small ponds. It is believed that the Krathongs
        carry away sins and bad luck, and the wishes that have been made for the
        new year due to start. Indeed, it is the time to be joyful and happy as
        the sufferings are floated away.

        The festival starts in the evening when there is a full moon in the sky.
        People of all walks of life carry their Krathongs to the nearby rivers.
        After lighting candles and joss-sticks and making a wish, they gently
        place the Krathongs on the water and let them drift away till they go
        out of sight. A Beauty Queen Contest is an important part of the
        festival and for this occasion, it is called "The Noppamas Queen
        Contest". Noppamas is a legendary figure from the Sukhothai period. Old
        documents refer to her as the chief royal consort of a Sukhothai Kng
        named "Lithai". Noppamas was said to have made the first decorated
        Krathong to float in the river on the occasion.
